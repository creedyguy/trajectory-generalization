# trajectory-generalization

More formally, In the case of GPS data, the GPS generates a trajectory by tracking an objectâ€™s movement as Trajectory  = $\{P_1, P_2, P_3, \dots, P_n\}$ , where $\{P_i\}$  denotes a combination of coordinates and time stamps such that Pi  = $\{x_i, y_i, t_i\}$. That is, each GPS point contains latitude $(x_i)$ , longitude $(y_i)$ and a timestamp $(t_i)$.
